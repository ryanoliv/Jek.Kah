          <p class="justified">
            Healing is a multi-layered process that goes beyond quick fixes.
            It's a transformative journey of self-discovery and growth.
            <br />
            <br />
            Meet Jessica, an experienced energy healing practitioner and
            spiritual guide. She offers a range of powerful services designed to
            support your healing and personal development. Whether you're
            seeking The Life Activation, Ensofic Reiki, Bad Habit Removal,

            <br />
            Her services are available both in-person globally and online,

            offers comprehensive support for your well-being and spiritual
            growth.
            <br />
            Through energy healings and activations, you'll experience the
            release of blockages and limiting beliefs that hinder your full
            potential. By letting go of unsupportive habits and creating space
            for positive change, you'll cultivate the life you truly desire.
            Jessica's healings, activations, and spiritual guidance empower you

            <br />
            At the heart of Jessica's practice is
            <a class="link darker" href="/life-activation.html">
              The Life Activation</a

            In the present day, it has become all too common for individuals to
            feel disconnected from their true selves. Past traumas or current
            events can uproot even the strongest minds, causing disillusionment
            and hopelessness to resurface, leading to negative thought patterns
            and unhealthy habits. This is where the importance of energetic
            healing and activations comes into play. These transformative
            practices create profound shifts within the mind, body, and soul,
            effectively shaping our future.
            <br />
            With Jessica as your guide, she will help you illuminate the shadows
            within, facilitate deep healing from within, and empower you to
            reclaim your power in life. Navigating through blockages and
            challenges, she approaches each session with authenticity and
            effectiveness.
            <br />
            Jessica's passion for energy work stems from her own healing journey
            and personal experiences with the power of energy. Having battled
            addiction since childhood, she has transformed her life into her
            desired reality through unwavering determination. It is her personal
            transformation that drives her to guide you in achieving your
            desired reality and living an empowered life.
            <br />
            With Jessica's guidance and expertise, you can embark on a journey
            of self-discovery, healing, and empowerment, transcending
            limitations and embracing your true potential.

                  "I am beyond grateful that Jess has introduced reiki into my
                  life. I was initially a little sceptical and not 100%
                  convinced of the benefits or how much of an impact a few reiki
                  sessions could have on me but I decided to give it a chance
                  last year March as I was curious, and I’m so glad I did! After
                  just the first session I felt calmer and more level-headed.
                  Every session after that built on that initial experience and
                  got better and better. I felt more focused, less anxious, and
                  more productive in my day to day. It felt like a weight had
                  been lifted off my shoulders and I was free to carry out my
                  daily responsibilities without anything holding me back. I
                  also felt I could connect with others easier as I felt more
                  present and less in my head and anxious. Jess is extremely
                  professional and knows how to create a safe space for her
                  clients so that they feel they can just be themselves and
                  relax. She is warm and empathetic, and lovingly welcomes you
                  into her peaceful and ambient space which immediately evokes a
                  sense of calm, and through a brief discussion helps you to
                  hone in on a specific intention to focus on throughout the
                  session. I highly recommend not only reiki, but also Jess in
                  particular, to anyone considering embarking on this journey!
                  Absolutely everyone can benefit enormously from a regular
                  reiki practice."

                  sessions. Jess held space so beautifully and resorted my
                  energy from a place of depletion to a place of hope and
                  growth. Her gentle yet firm presence made me feel vulnerable
                  enough to open up and let go, whilst still focusing on my own
                  innate power to heal and grow. She planted seeds of expansion
                  where I felt so stuck. She made me believe in myself, in the
                  power of subtle energy, and in the power to change and grow. I
                  feel that Jess is an extremely special soul who came to Earth
                  with a purpose- to invite others to heal themselves and she is
                  practicing this through her beautiful reiki sessions. Jess, I
                  can't thank you enough for the love and healing that you
                  poured into my body and mind. It was felt and treasured and
                  carried me when I needed it most. Thank you. ♥️🙏"

                  "I was very fortunate enough to catch Jess when she was
                  visiting Cape Town for a few months and decided to open up a
                  Reiki studio and offer Reiki sessions part time for a few
                  months during her stay. I was going through one of the hardest
                  changes in my life and really struggling to adapt and move
                  forward with things.. Jess reached out and introduced me to
                  reiki. I experienced two reiki healing sessions with her and
                  found them very powerful and emotional. After each session I
                  felt a deep sense of relaxation and calmness due to her
                  beautiful energy and reiki magic as well as more ‘light’ in my
                  head and emotions. After the first session the following day I
                  was very emotionally and cried quite a lot which helped with
                  releasing and letting go of what I was struggling to come to
                  terms with. I definitely think if Jessica had stayed in Cape
                  Town I would have loved to have carried on with reiki with her
                  as I think it really would have helped my emotional state and
                  help delve in and release past traumas, including childhood
                  ones that we only identify later on in life… Jessica is also
                  amazing to chat to and so wise. She’s got kind and gentle
                  energy and I think she makes the most wonderful reiki healer.
                  I highly recommend booking a session with her and giving reiki
                  a try! "

                  modalities throughout my life, however I had never experienced
                  Reiki until I found Jess. It is hard for me to completely open
                  up to healers, yet I felt very comfortable under Jess's hands.
                  I went for a weekly session, over a month, and It was an hour
                  every week that I was able to release, let go and give myself
                  a moment of self love. In today's stressful world, it's hard
                  to have a complete break from the chaos and so, just that one
                  hour with Jess was enough time to reboot, and re-energize. I
                  was able to shift stagnant energy and relieve emotional stress
                  that had built up and was stored in my body. I couldn't
                  recommend Reiki more, to anyone who is in need of a moment of
                  self, a moment of breath and a moment of connection, to your
                  spiritial being."

                  spoke to a Jessica about it and she recommended a Crystal
                  healing. It was an outstanding experience and it took a few
                  days and my eye had stopped twitching and I was already

                  forget as it was the first time I was truly aware of my energy
                  before and after a session. Having not done many reiki session
                  in my lifetime I was sure to set a specific intention which
                  was set to help me relive myself of a creative block I’d been
                  struggling with. Her work allowed myself and my space to be
                  free of my block. It is a pretty indescribable feeling,
                  especially when your personal knowledge is not in depth on the
                  healing process. It also relived some pain caused by an
                  autoimmune which was an added bonus and something I may not
                  have been aware was connected to my block if I had not been
                  open to the session. I recommend anyone to open yourself up to
                  Jess and her work."

                  "Floating out of my first session with Jess changed my reality
                  about the Reiki practice. Jeh.Kah. I didn’t believe someone
                  could guide the flow of energy, but I certainly felt it when I
                  was in this nurturing space – in Jess’s presence: Jessica
                  exudes love and is wise beyond her years. An old soul who
                  intuitively knows what your body needs to reduce stress and
                  promote healing. Not only does Jess balance your chakras, but
                  she calms your nervous system and connects your body with its
                  spiritual energy. I felt connected to Spirit. “The greatest
                  good you can do for another is not just share your riches, but
                  to reveal to him his own.” ― Benjamin Disraeli. I have been to
                  sessions with Jess that felt like 3 minutes although an actual
                  hour had elapsed. Jess ‘holds’ you in a safe space. She senses
                  your energy with the lightest touch. Tingling. Travelling.
                  Teleporting. Surreal sensations for sure. Connect with
                  Jeh.Kah. Connect with your highest self."

                  aftermath of my self-destruction. All I know is that I prayed
                  and worked to get to where I am now. A place I didn’t think
                  possible and I fear I will make the same mistakes as before or
                  I will not climb out of my own self doubt. I know I have
                  potential and everyone can see it, but I’m struggling to
                  action the potential. And I fear I’ll never become who I am
                  meant to be. . . After my life activation I didn’t feel
                  anything immediately. I felt however more aware and open to my
                  decision making process, used it for my lifestyle and the
                  changes that I was and am going through. And I remember one
                  thing out of this crazy experience is that Jess told me, “ You
                  might not feel different, but your energy is gana be
                  noticeable so choose how you wana move”. This stuck with me
                  and I noticed shifts and was riding a wave. But when I truly
                  noticed my shift, is in the dark days cause they still come, I
                  am much better prepared and can almost shift out or accept and
                  currently learning to shift it into “energy given” and me
                  using it as juice to fuel off and Conquer my old views of
                  mountains ive already climbed. It has made me way more
                  grateful for the blessings and decisions I have made that have
                  lead me here."

                  "It is during difficult times that you can really begin to
                  tell which friendships hold real value in your life. Recently
                  I went through one such experience. I felt helpless for months
                  and my mind was pre-occupied with the curveball that life had
                  thrown at me. Knowing me as well as Jess does, she could sense
                  that I was not in a good place. Without confronting me
                  directly, she gently reached out to me and gave me the space
                  to open up in my own time about the struggles I faced. She
                  told me that she had recently embarked on a path of intensive
                  spiritual growth and had participated in various healing
                  ceremonies and rituals, that she had helped others heal from
                  traumas, and that she herself had benefited from such
                  practices. She told me about a life activation ceremony she
                  had learned about and practised at the modern mystery school.
                  She explained that during this ceremony, a person’s crown
                  chakra cap is removed so that it no longer blocks the light
                  from shining on various aspects of your life that have been
                  invisible to you up until now. This passage of light gives you
                  the ability to see things differently and more clearly, and it
                  gives you the opportunity to confront various aspects of your
                  past and present, and to take action. This experience is
                  described by some as a gift of personal empowerment, an
                  expansion of your consciousness, and an opportunity to
                  kick-start your journey of personal and spiritual growth. As I
                  walked into Jess’s healing space, I immediately felt more at
                  peace with myself and my surroundings. The relaxed ambience
                  made me feel that it was safe to leave my daily stresses and
                  worries at the door so that I could embrace this experience
                  fully. She explained to me the next steps, how long the
                  ceremony would take, what would be required of me (eg standing
                  up for a period of time, breathing deeply at times, turning
                  your body when required, etc). She explained each step of the
                  process articulately and made me feel comfortable enough to
                  bring myself back to the present moment and to really immerse
                  myself fully in this experience. During the ceremony a lot of
                  memories and thoughts began to surface. At first I felt
                  overwhelmed, but after a while I became content as I realised
                  that this was not a bad thing, and that these flashes in my
                  mind were there for a reason. There was a lot of old stuff
                  coming up, and also some more recent memories. The thoughts
                  and flashbacks would come and go, some thoughts more intense
                  and demanding of my attention than others. However, throughout
                  the entire time I felt safe in Jess’s hands, as I could feel
                  her presence alternating from right beside me, to in front of
                  me and behind me throughout the ceremony. After the ceremony I
                  opened my eyes and I felt like I had been on a journey. My
                  body was completely relaxed. Not drained, just relaxed. I felt
                  cleansed, but not fully. I knew the work was only just about
                  to begin. The days and weeks after the ceremony had my mind
                  filled with thoughts, ideas, memories, emotions and plans. I
                  felt like there was so much to do and so much still to run
                  through in my mind. The beautiful thing about it is that,
                  although it was not easy, it was not stressful or painful
                  either. Even the sad bits had a positive element to them. I
                  felt like I could better see what had been causing the sadness
                  in me. I felt like I could better determine where I had gone
                  wrong at various times in my life and where others had gone
                  wrong in their encounters with me. I feel like I could really
                  start working on my flaws but most importantly whilst living
                  my life. Before I knew it, I had pulled myself out of a rut
                  and booked myself a holiday overseas with friends. I had moved
                  into a new apartment, and I had started exercising again. I
                  felt extremely proactive. I had started working on myself and
                  confronting the difficult issues in my life, but more
                  importantly, I had also started to show myself the love I
                  should have shown myself long before this healing experience.
                  This is what life activation is about. It opens your eyes and
                  shines light on the elements of your life that have been
                  hidden in the shadows. What you do with all this clarity is up
                  to you. This is not a magic pill. This is an opportunity for
                  you to take your life back."
