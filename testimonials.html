                "I am beyond grateful that Jess has introduced reiki into my
                life. I was initially a little sceptical and not 100% convinced
                of the benefits or how much of an impact a few reiki sessions
                could have on me but I decided to give it a chance last year
                March as I was curious, and I’m so glad I did! After just the
                first session I felt calmer and more level-headed. Every session
                after that built on that initial experience and got better and
                better. I felt more focused, less anxious, and more productive
                in my day to day. It felt like a weight had been lifted off my
                shoulders and I was free to carry out my daily responsibilities
                without anything holding me back. I also felt I could connect
                with others easier as I felt more present and less in my head
                and anxious. Jess is extremely professional and knows how to
                create a safe space for her clients so that they feel they can
                just be themselves and relax. She is warm and empathetic, and
                lovingly welcomes you into her peaceful and ambient space which
                immediately evokes a sense of calm, and through a brief
                discussion helps you to hone in on a specific intention to focus
                on throughout the session. I highly recommend not only reiki,
                but also Jess in particular, to anyone considering embarking on
                this journey! Absolutely everyone can benefit enormously from a
                regular reiki practice."

                sessions. Jess held space so beautifully and resorted my energy
                from a place of depletion to a place of hope and growth. Her
                gentle yet firm presence made me feel vulnerable enough to open
                up and let go, whilst still focusing on my own innate power to
                heal and grow. She planted seeds of expansion where I felt so
                stuck. She made me believe in myself, in the power of subtle
                energy, and in the power to change and grow. I feel that Jess is
                an extremely special soul who came to Earth with a purpose- to
                invite others to heal themselves and she is practicing this
                through her beautiful reiki sessions. Jess, I can't thank you
                enough for the love and healing that you poured into my body and
                mind. It was felt and treasured and carried me when I needed it
                most. Thank you. ♥️🙏"

                "I was very fortunate enough to catch Jess when she was visiting
                Cape Town for a few months and decided to open up a Reiki studio
                and offer Reiki sessions part time for a few months during her
                stay. I was going through one of the hardest changes in my life
                and really struggling to adapt and move forward with things..
                Jess reached out and introduced me to reiki. I experienced two
                reiki healing sessions with her and found them very powerful and
                emotional. After each session I felt a deep sense of relaxation
                and calmness due to her beautiful energy and reiki magic as well
                as more ‘light’ in my head and emotions. After the first session
                the following day I was very emotionally and cried quite a lot
                which helped with releasing and letting go of what I was
                struggling to come to terms with. I definitely think if Jessica
                had stayed in Cape Town I would have loved to have carried on
                with reiki with her as I think it really would have helped my
                emotional state and help delve in and release past traumas,
                including childhood ones that we only identify later on in life…
                Jessica is also amazing to chat to and so wise. She’s got kind
                and gentle energy and I think she makes the most wonderful reiki
                healer. I highly recommend booking a session with her and giving
                reiki a try! "

                "I have had the honor to experience many different healing
                modalities throughout my life, however I had never experienced
                Reiki until I found Jess. It is hard for me to completely open
                up to healers, yet I felt very comfortable under Jess's hands. I
                went for a weekly session, over a month, and It was an hour
                every week that I was able to release, let go and give myself a
                moment of self love. In today's stressful world, it's hard to
                have a complete break from the chaos and so, just that one hour
                with Jess was enough time to reboot, and re-energize. I was able
                to shift stagnant energy and relieve emotional stress that had
                built up and was stored in my body. I couldn't recommend Reiki
                more, to anyone who is in need of a moment of self, a moment of
                breath and a moment of connection, to your spiritial being."

                as it was the first time I was truly aware of my energy before
                and after a session. Having not done many reiki session in my
                lifetime I was sure to set a specific intention which was set to
                help me relive myself of a creative block I’d been struggling
                with. Her work allowed myself and my space to be free of my
                block. It is a pretty indescribable feeling, especially when
                your personal knowledge is not in depth on the healing process.
                It also relived some pain caused by an autoimmune which was an
                added bonus and something I may not have been aware was
                connected to my block if I had not been open to the session. I

                about the Reiki practice. Jeh.Kah. I didn’t believe someone
                could guide the flow of energy, but I certainly felt it when I
                was in this nurturing space – in Jess’s presence: Jessica exudes
                love and is wise beyond her years. An old soul who intuitively
                knows what your body needs to reduce stress and promote healing.
                Not only does Jess balance your chakras, but she calms your
                nervous system and connects your body with its spiritual energy.
                I felt connected to Spirit. “The greatest good you can do for
                another is not just share your riches, but to reveal to him his
                own.” ― Benjamin Disraeli. I have been to sessions with Jess
                that felt like 3 minutes although an actual hour had elapsed.
                Jess ‘holds’ you in a safe space. She senses your energy with
                the lightest touch. Tingling. Travelling. Teleporting. Surreal
                sensations for sure. Connect with Jeh.Kah. Connect with your
                highest self."

                potential. And I fear I’ll never become who I am meant to be. .
                . After my life activation I didn’t feel anything immediately. I
                felt however more aware and open to my decision making process,
                used it for my lifestyle and the changes that I was and am going
                through. And I remember one thing out of this crazy experience
                is that Jess told me, “ You might not feel different, but your
                energy is gana be noticeable so choose how you wana move”. This
                stuck with me and I noticed shifts and was riding a wave. But

                "It is during difficult times that you can really begin to tell
                which friendships hold real value in your life. Recently I went
                through one such experience. I felt helpless for months and my
                mind was pre-occupied with the curveball that life had thrown at
                me. Knowing me as well as Jess does, she could sense that I was
                not in a good place. Without confronting me directly, she gently
                reached out to me and gave me the space to open up in my own
                time about the struggles I faced. She told me that she had
                recently embarked on a path of intensive spiritual growth and
                had participated in various healing ceremonies and rituals, that
                she had helped others heal from traumas, and that she herself
                had benefited from such practices. She told me about a life
                activation ceremony she had learned about and practised at the
                modern mystery school. She explained that during this ceremony,
                a person’s crown chakra cap is removed so that it no longer
                blocks the light from shining on various aspects of your life
                that have been invisible to you up until now. This passage of
                light gives you the ability to see things differently and more
                clearly, and it gives you the opportunity to confront various
                aspects of your past and present, and to take action. This
                experience is described by some as a gift of personal
                empowerment, an expansion of your consciousness, and an
                opportunity to kick-start your journey of personal and spiritual
                growth. As I walked into Jess’s healing space, I immediately
                felt more at peace with myself and my surroundings. The relaxed
                ambience made me feel that it was safe to leave my daily
                stresses and worries at the door so that I could embrace this
                experience fully. She explained to me the next steps, how long
                the ceremony would take, what would be required of me (eg
                standing up for a period of time, breathing deeply at times,
                turning your body when required, etc). She explained each step
                of the process articulately and made me feel comfortable enough
                to bring myself back to the present moment and to really immerse
                myself fully in this experience. During the ceremony a lot of
                memories and thoughts began to surface. At first I felt
                overwhelmed, but after a while I became content as I realised
                that this was not a bad thing, and that these flashes in my mind
                were there for a reason. There was a lot of old stuff coming up,
                and also some more recent memories. The thoughts and flashbacks
                would come and go, some thoughts more intense and demanding of
                my attention than others. However, throughout the entire time I
                felt safe in Jess’s hands, as I could feel her presence
                alternating from right beside me, to in front of me and behind
                me throughout the ceremony. After the ceremony I opened my eyes
                and I felt like I had been on a journey. My body was completely
                relaxed. Not drained, just relaxed. I felt cleansed, but not
                fully. I knew the work was only just about to begin. The days
                and weeks after the ceremony had my mind filled with thoughts,
                ideas, memories, emotions and plans. I felt like there was so
                much to do and so much still to run through in my mind. The
                beautiful thing about it is that, although it was not easy, it
                was not stressful or painful either. Even the sad bits had a
                positive element to them. I felt like I could better see what
                had been causing the sadness in me. I felt like I could better
                determine where I had gone wrong at various times in my life and
                where others had gone wrong in their encounters with me. I feel
                like I could really start working on my flaws but most
                importantly whilst living my life. Before I knew it, I had
                pulled myself out of a rut and booked myself a holiday overseas
                with friends. I had moved into a new apartment, and I had
                started exercising again. I felt extremely proactive. I had
                started working on myself and confronting the difficult issues
                in my life, but more importantly, I had also started to show
                myself the love I should have shown myself long before this
                healing experience. This is what life activation is about. It
                opens your eyes and shines light on the elements of your life
                that have been hidden in the shadows. What you do with all this
                clarity is up to you. This is not a magic pill. This is an
                opportunity for you to take your life back."
