                "I am beyond grateful that Jess has introduced reiki into my
                life. I was initially a little sceptical and not 100% convinced
                of the benefits or how much of an impact a few reiki sessions
                could have on me but I decided to give it a chance last year
                March as I was curious, and I’m so glad I did! After just the
                first session I felt calmer and more level-headed. Every session
                after that built on that initial experience and got better and
                better. I felt more focused, less anxious, and more productive
                in my day to day. It felt like a weight had been lifted off my
                shoulders and I was free to carry out my daily responsibilities
                without anything holding me back. I also felt I could connect
                with others easier as I felt more present and less in my head
                and anxious. Jess is extremely professional and knows how to
                create a safe space for her clients so that they feel they can
                just be themselves and relax. She is warm and empathetic, and
                lovingly welcomes you into her peaceful and ambient space which
                immediately evokes a sense of calm, and through a brief
                discussion helps you to hone in on a specific intention to focus
                on throughout the session. I highly recommend not only reiki,
                but also Jess in particular, to anyone considering embarking on
                this journey! Absolutely everyone can benefit enormously from a
                regular reiki practice."

                "I went to Jess for three incredibly transformative reiki
                sessions. Jess held space so beautifully and resorted my energy
                from a place of depletion to a place of hope and growth. Her
                gentle yet firm presence made me feel vulnerable enough to open
                up and let go, whilst still focusing on my own innate power to
                heal and grow. She planted seeds of expansion where I felt so
                stuck. She made me believe in myself, in the power of subtle
                energy, and in the power to change and grow. I feel that Jess is
                an extremely special soul who came to Earth with a purpose- to
                invite others to heal themselves and she is practicing this
                through her beautiful reiki sessions. Jess, I can't thank you
                enough for the love and healing that you poured into my body and
                mind. It was felt and treasured and carried me when I needed it
                most. Thank you. ♥️🙏"

                your personal knowledge is not in depth on the healing process.
                It also relived some pain caused by an autoimmune which was an
                added bonus and something I may not have been aware was
                connected to my block if I had not been open to the session. I

                "I was very fortunate enough to catch Jess when she was visiting
                Cape Town for a few months and decided to open up a Reiki studio
                and offer Reiki sessions part time for a few months during her
                stay. I was going through one of the hardest changes in my life
                and really struggling to adapt and move forward with things..
                Jess reached out and introduced me to reiki. I experienced two
                reiki healing sessions with her and found them very powerful and
                emotional. After each session I felt a deep sense of relaxation
                and calmness due to her beautiful energy and reiki magic as well
                as more ‘light’ in my head and emotions. After the first session
                the following day I was very emotionally and cried quite a lot
                which helped with releasing and letting go of what I was
                struggling to come to terms with. I definitely think if Jessica
                had stayed in Cape Town I would have loved to have carried on
                with reiki with her as I think it really would have helped my
                emotional state and help delve in and release past traumas,
                including childhood ones that we only identify later on in life…
                Jessica is also amazing to chat to and so wise. She’s got kind
                and gentle energy and I think she makes the most wonderful reiki
                healer. I highly recommend booking a session with her and giving
                reiki a try! "

                "I am beyond grateful that Jess has introduced reiki into my
                life. I was initially a little sceptical and not 100% convinced
                of the benefits or how much of an impact a few reiki sessions
                could have on me but I decided to give it a chance last year
                March as I was curious, and I’m so glad I did! After just the
                first session I felt calmer and more level-headed. Every session
                after that built on that initial experience and got better and
                better. I felt more focused, less anxious, and more productive
                in my day to day. It felt like a weight had been lifted off my
                shoulders and I was free to carry out my daily responsibilities
                without anything holding me back. I also felt I could connect

                "Floating out of my first session with Jess changed my reality
                about the Reiki practice. Jeh.Kah. I didn’t believe someone
                could guide the flow of energy, but I certainly felt it when I
                was in this nurturing space – in Jess’s presence: Jessica exudes
                love and is wise beyond her years. An old soul who intuitively
                knows what your body needs to reduce stress and promote healing.
                Not only does Jess balance your chakras, but she calms your
                nervous system and connects your body with its spiritual energy.
                I felt connected to Spirit. “The greatest good you can do for
                another is not just share your riches, but to reveal to him his
                own.” ― Benjamin Disraeli. I have been to sessions with Jess
                that felt like 3 minutes although an actual hour had elapsed.
                Jess ‘holds’ you in a safe space. She senses your energy with
                the lightest touch. Tingling. Travelling. Teleporting. Surreal
                sensations for sure. Connect with Jeh.Kah. Connect with your
                highest self."

                "I am possibly the best version of myself mentally after the
                aftermath of my self-destruction. All I know is that I prayed
                and worked to get to where I am now. A place I didn’t think
                possible and I fear I will make the same mistakes as before or I
                will not climb out of my own self doubt. I know I have potential
                and everyone can see it, but I’m struggling to action the
                potential. And I fear I’ll never become who I am meant to be. .
                . After my life activation I didn’t feel anything immediately. I
                felt however more aware and open to my decision making process,
                used it for my lifestyle and the changes that I was and am going
                through. And I remember one thing out of this crazy experience
                is that Jess told me, “ You might not feel different, but your
                energy is gana be noticeable so choose how you wana move”. This
                stuck with me and I noticed shifts and was riding a wave. But
                when I truly noticed my shift, is in the dark days cause they
                still come, I am much better prepared and can almost shift out
                or accept and currently learning to shift it into “energy given”
                and me using it as juice to fuel off and Conquer my old views of
                mountains ive already climbed. It has made me way more grateful
                for the blessings and decisions I have made that have lead me

                "It is during difficult times that you can really begin to tell
                which friendships hold real value in your life. Recently I went
                through one such experience. I felt helpless for months and my
                mind was pre-occupied with the curveball that life had thrown at
                me. Knowing me as well as Jess does, she could sense that I was
                not in a good place. Without confronting me directly, she gently
                reached out to me and gave me the space to open up in my own
                time about the struggles I faced. She told me that she had
                recently embarked on a path of intensive spiritual growth and
                had participated in various healing ceremonies and rituals, that
                she had helped others heal from traumas, and that she herself
                had benefited from such practices. She told me about a life
                activation ceremony she had learned about and practised at the
                modern mystery school. She explained that during this ceremony,
                a person’s crown chakra cap is removed so that it no longer
                blocks the light from shining on various aspects of your life
                that have been invisible to you up until now. This passage of
                light gives you the ability to see things differently and more
                clearly, and it gives you the opportunity to confront various
                aspects of your past and present, and to take action. This
                experience is described by some as a gift of personal
                empowerment, an expansion of your consciousness, and an
                opportunity to kick-start your journey of personal and spiritual
                growth. As I walked into Jess’s healing space, I immediately
                felt more at peace with myself and my surroundings. The relaxed
                ambience made me feel that it was safe to leave my daily
                stresses and worries at the door so that I could embrace this
                experience fully. She explained to me the next steps, how long
                the ceremony would take, what would be required of me (eg
                standing up for a period of time, breathing deeply at times,
                turning your body when required, etc). She explained each step
                of the process articulately and made me feel comfortable enough
                to bring myself back to the present moment and to really immerse
                myself fully in this experience. During the ceremony a lot of
                memories and thoughts began to surface. At first I felt
                overwhelmed, but after a while I became content as I realised
                that this was not a bad thing, and that these flashes in my mind
                were there for a reason. There was a lot of old stuff coming up,
                and also some more recent memories. The thoughts and flashbacks
                would come and go, some thoughts more intense and demanding of
                my attention than others. However, throughout the entire time I
                felt safe in Jess’s hands, as I could feel her presence
                alternating from right beside me, to in front of me and behind
                me throughout the ceremony. After the ceremony I opened my eyes
                and I felt like I had been on a journey. My body was completely
                relaxed. Not drained, just relaxed. I felt cleansed, but not
                fully. I knew the work was only just about to begin. The days
                and weeks after the ceremony had my mind filled with thoughts,
                ideas, memories, emotions and plans. I felt like there was so
                much to do and so much still to run through in my mind. The
                beautiful thing about it is that, although it was not easy, it
                was not stressful or painful either. Even the sad bits had a
                positive element to them. I felt like I could better see what
                had been causing the sadness in me. I felt like I could better
                determine where I had gone wrong at various times in my life and
                where others had gone wrong in their encounters with me. I feel
                like I could really start working on my flaws but most
                importantly whilst living my life. Before I knew it, I had
                pulled myself out of a rut and booked myself a holiday overseas
                with friends. I had moved into a new apartment, and I had
                started exercising again. I felt extremely proactive. I had
                started working on myself and confronting the difficult issues
                in my life, but more importantly, I had also started to show
                myself the love I should have shown myself long before this
                healing experience. This is what life activation is about. It
                opens your eyes and shines light on the elements of your life
                that have been hidden in the shadows. What you do with all this
                clarity is up to you. This is not a magic pill. This is an
                opportunity for you to take your life back."

                “I would like to start off by mentioning that I am someone who,
                generally speaking, does not truly believe anything that I
                can’t/haven’t verified using my own senses. This does not mean
                that I disregard any knowledge that I can’t prove, but rather, I
                view this knowledge as one of many possibilities. With this in
                mind, I will speak about my experiences before and after my life
                activation. <br />
                I did not actively seek out a life activation and I believe that
                I did not adequately prepare myself for it. I think the reason
                for this is that I, on some level, was sceptical of Jessica’s
                methods. This is due to the fact that Jessica works beyond my
                current understanding of the world and how it works. I have
                since come to the conclusion that it doesn’t matter whether or
                not I understand Jessica’s methods because the results speak for
                themselves. There have been a number of positive changes in my
                life, that occurred almost immediately after my life activation.
                Based on this evidence, the only logical inference is that these
                changes are a result of my life activation. One might wonder why
                I decided to take part in the life activation in the first place
                if I was somewhat sceptical of Jessica’s methods. This is
                because, based on my experiences and the time that I have spent
                with Jessica, I know that she is someone who is a force for good
                in this world and that she is here to make a difference. Jessica
                is one of the few people who I trust wholeheartedly and I know
                that everything that she does is done with wholesome intent, and
                her actions, whether directly or indirectly, make the world a
                better place. By virtue of my trust and belief in Jessica, I was
                left with no choice but to believe and trust in her methods.<br />
                As previously mentioned, there were a number of positive changes
                that occurred in my life after my life activation. The first and
                most apparent of these changes had to do with my academic
                career. Shortly after my life activation, I hit a “roadblock”
                with my studies. Usually, this would have sent me into a
                tailspin, as I would have been overcome with feelings of
                anxiety, frustration, and maybe even fear; however, this was not
                the case. Not only did I not experience any of these negative
                emotions, I actually had a feeling of calmness and acceptance
                when faced with my dilemma. I was able to calmly assess the
                situation I was in, and make changes to my life that allowed
                several new paths to open up to me. This change has not only
                provided me with the opportunity to advance my academic and
                professional career but it has also provided me with a path that
                I believe will allow me to reach my full potential in both a
                personal and spiritual capacity. <br />
                Another change that occurred after my life activation is my
                ability to let go of thoughts, feelings, behaviours, and beliefs
                that are counterproductive to me living a truly happy life. Even
                before my life activation, I knew that these things were harmful
                to me, however, for some reason, I was unable to let go of them.
                It was as if there was some unconscious mental block that
                prevented me from letting go, however, after my life activation,
                this mental block seems to have disappeared and now I have the
                ability to let go of things that are harmful and don’t serve me.
                It's not like I am now able to let go of everything all at once,
                but rather, it is a gradual process of assessment and
                elimination. I still have a lot of work to do with regards to
                this but I am grateful for what this ability has done for me
                thus far and I look forward to using this ability as I move
                forward in this new chapter of my life. <br />
                Lastly, what I deem as the most important change since my life
                activation, is the enhancement of my intuition. This has been a
                subtle change but I believe that it will become the most
                powerful guiding factor as I continue to progress through my
                life. As someone who has generally relied on logic and reasoning
                to navigate the world around them, I thought of intuition as
                some mythical fallacy and totally disregarded it. I believe that
                my intuition has always been there, however, I never followed it
                due to my own ignorance. Looking back, I do not view this
                ignorance as a good or bad thing but rather, a necessary step in
                order to get to where I am today. I now see that intuition is a
                means of directly perceiving reality and interacting with the
                world around me, without being hindered by logic and reasoning.
                Yes, the very foundation of my worldview actually serves as a
                hindrance to how I perceive the world around me. By relying on
                my intuition, it feels as if I am slowly escaping the trap that
                I have created within my mind. This does not mean that I have
                this whole intuition thing figured out or that I understand the
                processes behind it. If anything, it is quite the opposite.
                Metaphorically speaking, I am the frog in a well who knows
                nothing of the sea. However, thanks to Jessica, I now know that
                the “sea” exists and I look forward to gaining further insight
                into intuition and how it reveals itself. <br />
                All in all, I am extremely grateful that I had the opportunity
                to receive my life activation and I look forward to all the
                changes it will bring about in the future.”

                “I was a bit unsure after choosing to do a life activation
                session with Jess. The session felt good and not going to lie, I
                was skeptical. See, I had not done this before, however, being
                around Jess and seeing how she is, her life force and her ways
                of being, I knew that energy has to come from a place of being
                connected. This made me want to do a session. And then Jess made
                it comfortable and easy to be present.
                <br />
                <br />
                Immediately after the session I was very aware of my spinal
                column, I somehow felt energized and calm at the same time. For
                a time afterwards it seems like I noticed more of my the
                decisions I am making, I am a yoga teacher and I have a strong
                personal practice, so living slow and intentionaly is the norm,
                there was just a different quality to it. I am still on this
                journey and I am still understanding what has happened within me
                and it has been a couple of months already (at the time of

                “I have done two life activations and one with Jess. Both have
                really expanded my field of experience and helped me to start to
                process elements of my life. This journey has made my life
                lighter by shedding anxiety, clarity by knowing I’m on the right
                path and patience that everything will work out in its place.
                Jess is a very gifted, warm and relatable healer that I feel
                incredibly blessed to have in my corner in this crazy life!”

              <p class="testimonials--text">
                “I would like to start off by mentioning that I am someone who,
                generally speaking, does not truly believe anything that I
                can’t/haven’t verified using my own senses. This does not mean
                that I disregard any knowledge that I can’t prove, but rather, I
                view this knowledge as one of many possibilities. With this in
                mind, I will speak about my experiences before and after my life
                activation. <br />
                I did not actively seek out a life activation and I believe that
                I did not adequately prepare myself for it. I think the reason
                for this is that I, on some level, was sceptical of Jessica’s
                methods. This is due to the fact that Jessica works beyond my
                current understanding of the world and how it works. I have
                since come to the conclusion that it doesn’t matter whether or
                not I understand Jessica’s methods because the results speak for
                themselves. There have been a number of positive changes in my
                life, that occurred almost immediately after my life activation.
                Based on this evidence, the only logical inference is that these
                changes are a result of my life activation. One might wonder why
                I decided to take part in the life activation in the first place
                if I was somewhat sceptical of Jessica’s methods. This is
                because, based on my experiences and the time that I have spent
                with Jessica, I know that she is someone who is a force for good
                in this world and that she is here to make a difference. Jessica
                is one of the few people who I trust wholeheartedly and I know
                that everything that she does is done with wholesome intent, and
                her actions, whether directly or indirectly, make the world a
                better place. By virtue of my trust and belief in Jessica, I was
                left with no choice but to believe and trust in her methods.<br />
                As previously mentioned, there were a number of positive changes
                that occurred in my life after my life activation. The first and
                most apparent of these changes had to do with my academic
                career. Shortly after my life activation, I hit a “roadblock”
                with my studies. Usually, this would have sent me into a
                tailspin, as I would have been overcome with feelings of
                anxiety, frustration, and maybe even fear; however, this was not
                the case. Not only did I not experience any of these negative
                emotions, I actually had a feeling of calmness and acceptance
                when faced with my dilemma. I was able to calmly assess the
                situation I was in, and make changes to my life that allowed
                several new paths to open up to me. This change has not only
                provided me with the opportunity to advance my academic and
                professional career but it has also provided me with a path that
                I believe will allow me to reach my full potential in both a
                personal and spiritual capacity. <br />
                Another change that occurred after my life activation is my
                ability to let go of thoughts, feelings, behaviours, and beliefs
                that are counterproductive to me living a truly happy life. Even
                before my life activation, I knew that these things were harmful
                to me, however, for some reason, I was unable to let go of them.
                It was as if there was some unconscious mental block that
                prevented me from letting go, however, after my life activation,
                this mental block seems to have disappeared and now I have the
                ability to let go of things that are harmful and don’t serve me.
                It's not like I am now able to let go of everything all at once,
                but rather, it is a gradual process of assessment and
                elimination. I still have a lot of work to do with regards to
                this but I am grateful for what this ability has done for me
                thus far and I look forward to using this ability as I move
                forward in this new chapter of my life. <br />
                Lastly, what I deem as the most important change since my life
                activation, is the enhancement of my intuition. This has been a
                subtle change but I believe that it will become the most
                powerful guiding factor as I continue to progress through my
                life. As someone who has generally relied on logic and reasoning
                to navigate the world around them, I thought of intuition as
                some mythical fallacy and totally disregarded it. I believe that
                my intuition has always been there, however, I never followed it
                due to my own ignorance. Looking back, I do not view this
                ignorance as a good or bad thing but rather, a necessary step in
                order to get to where I am today. I now see that intuition is a
                means of directly perceiving reality and interacting with the
                world around me, without being hindered by logic and reasoning.
                Yes, the very foundation of my worldview actually serves as a
                hindrance to how I perceive the world around me. By relying on
                my intuition, it feels as if I am slowly escaping the trap that
                I have created within my mind. This does not mean that I have
                this whole intuition thing figured out or that I understand the
                processes behind it. If anything, it is quite the opposite.
                Metaphorically speaking, I am the frog in a well who knows
                nothing of the sea. However, thanks to Jessica, I now know that
                the “sea” exists and I look forward to gaining further insight
                into intuition and how it reveals itself. <br />
                All in all, I am extremely grateful that I had the opportunity
                to receive my life activation and I look forward to all the
                changes it will bring about in the future.”

                “My 2023 ended with strong mental shifts. Making me feel lost in
                what I needed to do. Having Jess as a friend, I decided to reach
                out.
                <br />
                I did a crystal healing and a life activation. It helped me to
                clear my head and to look deep within myself to bring the
                emotions to the surface and let them out. Just sitting and
                talking with Jess afterwards makes you see things differently
                and she makes you realize what a good person you can be."

                "I had an activation done by Jessica about 2 months ago and it
                was my first time being introduced to the experience. I had no
                expectations of what to expect and what it would entail and no
                expectations of where it would lead. It was a beautiful
                experience from the start and is continuing to be so even now.
                The contrast of gentle energy and powerful energy during the
                session was both profound and tangible. The result was immediate
                as I could feel that a gateway for healing had been opened. The
                path ahead is lighter than before. So much has changed for me.
                The life activation allowed me to be myself. It helped me shift

                time. My heart was craving changes, acceptance, and love.<br />
                Somewhere on the way after the session, I awake my understanding

                can, 'Let it go!'. <br />
                I reminded myself that belonging is lying in my heart all time
                long. During the session, I have a vision in my head, of
                releasing myself of chains and holders, taking dark cover off my
                back and stepping naked, free, in the future.

                "I was very nervous and skeptical doing the life activation,
                hadn’t heard of or experienced this before.
                <br />
                Jess was an absolute Angel, guided me, reassured me, made sure I
                was totally informed throughout the process and was totally at
                peace with myself and the surroundings.
                <br />
                <br />
                She talked me gently through each step of the process and
                literally held my hand, killing all nervousness and any
                negativity or skepticism I might have had.
                <br />
                I have had some previous traumas and was going through quite a
                bad patch, and Jess kinda sensed that and made contact totally
                out of the blue, we’d known each other for some time and I had
                no idea she was practising these teachings.
                <br />
                Throughout the process I felt safe and at peace, felt the energy
                and peace, and it was really a journey visiting my past, closing
                those old wounds and negativity. I felt completely relaxed and
                would go so far as to say, cleansed.
                <br />
                Didn’t feel any changes immediately but the days after, I felt
                more energised, positivity flowed and the shift in energy was
                transforming, in the best possible way.
                <br />
                My self confidence increased ten fold, and I can’t even begin to
                describe the mental benefits to my health, sleep, diet and
                exercise. All these showed drastic changes and only for the
                better. I’ve cut off people that were toxic in my life, and
                refuse to accept anybody into my circle that brings any ounce of
                negativity or that does not add value or any harmony. My quality
                of life has experienced a drastic shift, moved to a new place,
                took that long overdue holiday, and noticed a tremendous shift
                in wealth. I’ve also begun giving back to those less fortunate
                around me and started uplifting those experiencing tough times
                all because I am now in a position to be able to do so. Jess, i
                can’t thank you enough, I am eternally grateful and so look
                forward to seeing you back in Cape Town so that i can maybe do
                this again or experience one of the other healing services you
                offer.
                <br />
                <br />
                Blessings, Peace and Abundance your way and may you continue to

                "I've been thinking a lot about the activation process you had
                in me and how some things have changed since then. I know for
                sure that the universe put you in my path at a time when I was
                already more energetically open to it and that everything
                happened at the right time. Looking back, it's like I was
                already in a process of change and the life activation energised
                and potentiated it to another level. At times, I feel as if my
                life is moving much faster, that feelings and experiences are
                more intense, that decisions are taken more quickly, that what
                needs to be said is communicated with more eloquence and
                accuracy, wills are more accepted and desires are fulfilled.
                It's as if things came to me with less effort and, in a way, as
                if I could believe more in an inner voice, which can be
                intuition, spirituality, guides. Anyway, be it what each person
                believes.
                <br />
                Every morning and evening, when I take my drops, it’s almost
                like I’m filling my body and spirit with a bit more of hope and
                strength to keep doing what I need to. On the other hand, as
                life goes, when something not that good happens and it’s s
                difficult to keep thinking positively, it’s like the activation
                of life also served to remind me of who I am and of all the good
                things I have and deserve. I feel like it's a mental and
                spiritual boost for me to follow my path. Again, I wanted to
                thank you for the afternoon we had during the activation and for
                suggesting this process to me. I will certainly not forget and I
                also know that much of what I am experiencing today is the
                outcome of this process that can be read in different ways but
                which, for me, is the result of my reconnection with myself, in
                mental, physical and spiritual aspects.
                <br />
                <br />
                Thank you so much and hope to see you soon!"

                "I decided to attend Life/ DNA Activation with dear Jess in
                time. My heart was craving changes, acceptance, and love.<br />
                Somewhere on the way after the session, I awake my understanding
                that I am enough, and that even is so heartbreaking, I have, and
                can, 'Let it go!'. <br />
                I reminded myself that belonging is lying in my heart all time
                long. During the session, I have a vision in my head, of
                releasing myself of chains and holders, taking dark cover off my
                back and stepping naked, free, in the future.
                <br />
                Fear of unknown change to hope and confidence, excitement, and
                strength.
                <br />
                I keep reminding myself every day since it is a journey. And I
                deserve and will not settle for nothing less than happiness. My
                fulfillment is awaiting for me in my future, dedication, and
                goals! I believe that universe, and my desire complied with my
                decision to meet Jessica and experience such vision! I believe
                that everything happens as it meant to be, and that was my
                moment of transition! Thank you, Jess, for being bless on my
                path."

                what to expect. Life has been very hard recently and I struggle
                with complex PTSD as an after effect. The experience was magical
                and beautiful. During the meditation something was present,
                actively opening me up and allowing for a light to shine in
                places it never has. A sense of understanding follows in the
                days after the session. - profound understanding. My life path
                actually felt like it's meant to go somewhere & isnt going to be
                cut short. It gave me the willingness and strength to keep
                going. I cannot say enough how powerful the experience has been
                during and after. I highly recommend a Life Activation with
                Jess. My body feels cleansed and detoxed from old energies that
                are no longer serving me. Thank you Jess."

                thought had already changed. When I returned home. I wasn’t
                looking to relax but it was if a bee in my bonnet needed to get
                to work. I was ready to change, to shift. I sorted out over 200
                plants that haven’t been touched since my stomach tumour last
                year. It’s as if the stagnant energy was wiped away and so much

                healing as we had so much resonance. Her way of running her
                session is very smooth. I felt totally in a peace placed between
                her hands. I had the sensation of being blessed. She offers me
                so much light and vibrations. Still infusing softly in my all
                body. I deeply recommend Jessica’s healing, it’s an
                unforgettable experience. With all my love, Elisabeth, Pur Lux."

              <p class="testimonials--text">
                "Life activation with Jess was pure magic, in the moment but
                mostly the effects afterwards. When I first heard about it I
                wasn’t really sure what it meant. Jess explained it me
                thoroughly and energetically cleaned the room beforehand. I did
                the session mid May (it is now end of July), it was very
                powerful and a whirlwind of emotions came up but I felt safe and
                supported throughout. For me it set a chain of events in motion
                in the most positive way, and which I never really expected. I
                think it triggered a deeper understanding of where I was and
                where I want to be. I’ve come to the realisation that I was
                running away and numbing myself from certain aspects of life and
                never had the energy or understanding to do something about it.
                Since then, little by little I’ve been making smaller and bigger
                changes to my life. Paving the path to what I truly desire which
                is becoming clearer with each step I take. In my experience,
                life activation is a catalyst and just the beginning of becoming
                more clear and forming deeper and more meaningful connections
                with myself and my environment."
