        <h2>What is a Life Activation?</h2>
        <p>
          Life activation is a sacred and powerful in-person healing session
          that rebalances, realigns, and attunes your entire energy system. It
          shines a light on all the parts that need awakening while illuminating
          the dark parts that must be exposed and accepted. A Life activation is
          designed to help you access your potential in life and witness and
          progress in your journey of growth.
          <br />
          <br />
          Life activation infuses your body with pure Light, which weaves its
          way through blockages, issues, and weaknesses that we may not even be
          aware of. It’s the first step to becoming who you truly are.
          <br />
          <br />
          In addition to the Life Activation itself, this session includes
          several energy alignments to help you achieve a sense of peace and
          connection between your mind, body, and spirit. The treatment will
          give you a greater sense of clarity and understanding of who you are
          and your purpose.
          <br />
          <br />
          Life Activation establishes the groundwork for deeper healing.
          Sometimes effects are immediate and obvious, while others can be
          subtle.
          <br />
          <br />
          Jessica is honoured to be able to offer this sacred life
          transformational healing and is available on WhatsApp after a session
          to help any client with integration after a Life Activation.

          activation Aftercare of Purificato & Crystalis, elixirs to help with
          detoxing & integration. As toxins are released from the DNA (genetic,
          environmental & emotional debris), the elixir neutralizes the effects
          these toxins will have as they are moving out of the system.

            "I am possibly the best version of myself mentally after the
            aftermath of my self-destruction. All I know is that I prayed and
            worked to get to where I am now. A place I didn’t think possible and
            I fear I will make the same mistakes as before or I will not climb
            out of my own self doubt. I know I have potential and everyone can
            see it, but I’m struggling to action the potential. And I fear I’ll
            never become who I am meant to be. . . After my life activation I
            didn’t feel anything immediately. I felt however more aware and open
            to my decision making process, used it for my lifestyle and the
            changes that I was and am going through. And I remember one thing
            out of this crazy experience is that Jess told me, “ You might not
            feel different, but your energy is gana be noticeable so choose how
            you wana move”. This stuck with me and I noticed shifts and was
            riding a wave. But when I truly noticed my shift, is in the dark
            days cause they still come, I am much better prepared and can almost
            shift out or accept and currently learning to shift it into “energy
            given” and me using it as juice to fuel off and Conquer my old views
            of mountains ive already climbed. It has made me way more grateful
            for the blessings and decisions I have made that have lead me here."

            "It is during difficult times that you can really begin to tell
            which friendships hold real value in your life. Recently I went
            through one such experience. I felt helpless for months and my mind
            was pre-occupied with the curveball that life had thrown at me.
            Knowing me as well as Jess does, she could sense that I was not in a
            good place. Without confronting me directly, she gently reached out
            to me and gave me the space to open up in my own time about the
            struggles I faced. She told me that she had recently embarked on a
            path of intensive spiritual growth and had participated in various
            healing ceremonies and rituals, that she had helped others heal from
            traumas, and that she herself had benefited from such practices. She
            told me about a life activation ceremony she had learned about and
            practised at the modern mystery school. She explained that during
            this ceremony, a person’s crown chakra cap is removed so that it no
            longer blocks the light from shining on various aspects of your life
            that have been invisible to you up until now. This passage of light
            gives you the ability to see things differently and more clearly,
            and it gives you the opportunity to confront various aspects of your
            past and present, and to take action. This experience is described
            by some as a gift of personal empowerment, an expansion of your
            consciousness, and an opportunity to kick-start your journey of
            personal and spiritual growth. As I walked into Jess’s healing
            space, I immediately felt more at peace with myself and my
            surroundings. The relaxed ambience made me feel that it was safe to
            leave my daily stresses and worries at the door so that I could
            embrace this experience fully. She explained to me the next steps,
            how long the ceremony would take, what would be required of me (eg
            standing up for a period of time, breathing deeply at times, turning
            your body when required, etc). She explained each step of the
            process articulately and made me feel comfortable enough to bring
            myself back to the present moment and to really immerse myself fully
            in this experience. During the ceremony a lot of memories and
            thoughts began to surface. At first I felt overwhelmed, but after a
            while I became content as I realised that this was not a bad thing,
            and that these flashes in my mind were there for a reason. There was
            a lot of old stuff coming up, and also some more recent memories.
            The thoughts and flashbacks would come and go, some thoughts more
            intense and demanding of my attention than others. However,
            throughout the entire time I felt safe in Jess’s hands, as I could
            feel her presence alternating from right beside me, to in front of
            me and behind me throughout the ceremony. After the ceremony I
            opened my eyes and I felt like I had been on a journey. My body was
            completely relaxed. Not drained, just relaxed. I felt cleansed, but
            not fully. I knew the work was only just about to begin. The days
            and weeks after the ceremony had my mind filled with thoughts,
            ideas, memories, emotions and plans. I felt like there was so much
            to do and so much still to run through in my mind. The beautiful
            thing about it is that, although it was not easy, it was not
            stressful or painful either. Even the sad bits had a positive
            element to them. I felt like I could better see what had been
            causing the sadness in me. I felt like I could better determine
            where I had gone wrong at various times in my life and where others
            had gone wrong in their encounters with me. I feel like I could
            really start working on my flaws but most importantly whilst living
            my life. Before I knew it, I had pulled myself out of a rut and
            booked myself a holiday overseas with friends. I had moved into a
            new apartment, and I had started exercising again. I felt extremely
            proactive. I had started working on myself and confronting the
            difficult issues in my life, but more importantly, I had also
            started to show myself the love I should have shown myself long
            before this healing experience. This is what life activation is
            about. It opens your eyes and shines light on the elements of your
            life that have been hidden in the shadows. What you do with all this
            clarity is up to you. This is not a magic pill. This is an
            opportunity for you to take your life back."
