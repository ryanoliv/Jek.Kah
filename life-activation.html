            <br />
            <br />
            The Life Activation is a sacred and powerful in-person healing
            session that rebalances, realigns, and attunes your entire energy
            system. It illuminates the parts of yourself that need awakening
            while shedding light on the dark aspects that require exposure and
            acceptance. By accessing your potential in life, the Life Activation
            enables you to witness and progress on your journey of growth.
            <br />
            <br />
            During the Life Activation, your body is infused with pure Light,
            which penetrates and weaves its way through blockages, issues, and
            weaknesses, even those that may remain unnoticed. It serves as the
            initial step toward becoming your true and authentic self.
            <br />
            <br />
            In addition to the Life Activation itself, this session includes
            various energy alignments to establish peace and connection between
            your mind, body, and spirit. The treatment brings about a greater
            sense of clarity and understanding of your true essence and purpose.
            <br />
            <br />
            The Life Activation sets the groundwork for deeper healing and
            transformation. Its effects can be immediate and evident, while
            others may manifest more subtly over time.

          A reading based on what was found during the energy balancing and DNA
          activation Aftercare of Purificato and Crystalis, elixirs to help with
          detoxing and integration. As toxins are released from the DNA
          (genetic, environmental and emotional debris), the elixir neutralises
          the effects these toxins will have as they are moving out of the
          system.
        </p>

        <h3 class="t-align">Elixirs:</h3>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          Purificato and Crystalis is purchased with the Activation to help with
          detoxing and integration. As toxins are released from the DNA
          (genetic, environmental and emotional debris), the elixir neutralises
          the effects these toxins will have as they are moving out of the
          system. This is a once off session but Top-up sessions are optional
          and recommended to accelerate your progression. This could be done
          every 3-6 months.
          <br />
          <br />
          After the Life/DNA Activation as one’s vibration raises, what most
          blocks the uptake of light are toxins in the body. These toxins need
          to be flushed out in order for the individual to hold more light. We
          have found the most effective method for detoxing and integrating the
          Life Activation to be the alchemical product called Purificato and
          Crystalis.
          <br />
          <br />
          The Elixir is made in two versions, which are only sold as a set as
          they are designed to be taken together – Purificato and Crystalis.
          <br />
          <br />
          Purificato removes cellular levels of debris in the DNA resulting from
          environmental toxins, virus and bacterial exposure, and fungal
          overgrowth. When this debris is present, it hinders the assimilation
          of Light and consequently suppresses the expression of your spiritual
          gifts. Purificato works best when the body is awake and in motion,
          which helps release and neutralise debris. Directions for Use: Take 7
          drops of Purificato under the tongue in the morning. No preparation is
          necessary. Refrigeration is optional.
          <br />

          Crystalis removes genetic debris and intentionally clears genetic
          damage since conception. Helping you maintain a focus in your
          spiritual life, it cleans up your genetic codes, the last dense
          physical structures in the DNA that hinder full spiritual awareness,
          and awakens your Divinity Codes. Crystalis is best taken as you relax
          and sleep. Directions for Use: Take 7 drops of Crystalis under the
          tongue in the evening, just before going to bed. No preparation is
          necessary. Refrigeration is optional.

          As the toxins and debris are removed from the cellular levels, they
          are neutralised by the Elixir and flushed out of the body. In using
          both of these elixirs, one can experience full contact with the powers
          of the aura and the soul. With this empowerment, one will be healthier
          at the cellular level, be in better physical shape, and sense the
          higher power of Spirit flowing through you. This can in turn create a
          balanced state of mind and body that gives an increase in the overall
          emotional state of acceptance, joy, happiness and success in life.
          Because debris in the body hinders the assimilation of Light, to excel
          and take the next step as a human one needs to eliminate this debris.
          The transmutational effects empower the Gifts of the Spirit to emerge.

            "I am possibly the best version of myself mentally after the
            aftermath of my self-destruction. All I know is that I prayed and
            worked to get to where I am now. A place I didn’t think possible and
            I fear I will make the same mistakes as before or I will not climb
            out of my own self doubt. I know I have potential and everyone can
            see it, but I’m struggling to action the potential. And I fear I’ll
            never become who I am meant to be. . . After my life activation I
            didn’t feel anything immediately. I felt however more aware and open
            to my decision making process, used it for my lifestyle and the
            changes that I was and am going through. And I remember one thing
            out of this crazy experience is that Jess told me, “ You might not
            feel different, but your energy is gana be noticeable so choose how
            you wana move”. This stuck with me and I noticed shifts and was
            riding a wave. But when I truly noticed my shift, is in the dark
            days cause they still come, I am much better prepared and can almost
            shift out or accept and currently learning to shift it into “energy
            given” and me using it as juice to fuel off and Conquer my old views
            of mountains ive already climbed. It has made me way more grateful
            for the blessings and decisions I have made that have lead me here."

            "It is during difficult times that you can really begin to tell
            which friendships hold real value in your life. Recently I went
            through one such experience. I felt helpless for months and my mind
            was pre-occupied with the curveball that life had thrown at me.
            Knowing me as well as Jess does, she could sense that I was not in a
            good place. Without confronting me directly, she gently reached out
            to me and gave me the space to open up in my own time about the
            struggles I faced. She told me that she had recently embarked on a
            path of intensive spiritual growth and had participated in various
            healing ceremonies and rituals, that she had helped others heal from
            traumas, and that she herself had benefited from such practices. She
            told me about a life activation ceremony she had learned about and
            practised at the modern mystery school. She explained that during
            this ceremony, a person’s crown chakra cap is removed so that it no
            longer blocks the light from shining on various aspects of your life
            that have been invisible to you up until now. This passage of light
            gives you the ability to see things differently and more clearly,
            and it gives you the opportunity to confront various aspects of your
            past and present, and to take action. This experience is described
            by some as a gift of personal empowerment, an expansion of your
            consciousness, and an opportunity to kick-start your journey of
            personal and spiritual growth. As I walked into Jess’s healing
            space, I immediately felt more at peace with myself and my
            surroundings. The relaxed ambience made me feel that it was safe to
            leave my daily stresses and worries at the door so that I could
            embrace this experience fully. She explained to me the next steps,
            how long the ceremony would take, what would be required of me (eg
            standing up for a period of time, breathing deeply at times, turning
            your body when required, etc). She explained each step of the
            process articulately and made me feel comfortable enough to bring
            myself back to the present moment and to really immerse myself fully
            in this experience. During the ceremony a lot of memories and
            thoughts began to surface. At first I felt overwhelmed, but after a
            while I became content as I realised that this was not a bad thing,
            and that these flashes in my mind were there for a reason. There was
            a lot of old stuff coming up, and also some more recent memories.
            The thoughts and flashbacks would come and go, some thoughts more
            intense and demanding of my attention than others. However,
            throughout the entire time I felt safe in Jess’s hands, as I could
            feel her presence alternating from right beside me, to in front of
            me and behind me throughout the ceremony. After the ceremony I
            opened my eyes and I felt like I had been on a journey. My body was
            completely relaxed. Not drained, just relaxed. I felt cleansed, but
            not fully. I knew the work was only just about to begin. The days
            and weeks after the ceremony had my mind filled with thoughts,
            ideas, memories, emotions and plans. I felt like there was so much
            to do and so much still to run through in my mind. The beautiful
            thing about it is that, although it was not easy, it was not
            stressful or painful either. Even the sad bits had a positive
            element to them. I felt like I could better see what had been
            causing the sadness in me. I felt like I could better determine
            where I had gone wrong at various times in my life and where others
            had gone wrong in their encounters with me. I feel like I could
            really start working on my flaws but most importantly whilst living
            my life. Before I knew it, I had pulled myself out of a rut and
            booked myself a holiday overseas with friends. I had moved into a
            new apartment, and I had started exercising again. I felt extremely
            proactive. I had started working on myself and confronting the
            difficult issues in my life, but more importantly, I had also
            started to show myself the love I should have shown myself long
            before this healing experience. This is what life activation is
            about. It opens your eyes and shines light on the elements of your
            life that have been hidden in the shadows. What you do with all this
            clarity is up to you. This is not a magic pill. This is an
            opportunity for you to take your life back."

            “I was a bit unsure after choosing to do a life activation session
            with Jess. The session felt good and not going to lie, I was
            skeptical. See, I had not done this before, however, being around
            Jess and seeing how she is, her life force and her ways of being, I
            knew that energy has to come from a place of being connected. This
            made me want to do a session. And then Jess made it comfortable and
            easy to be present.
            <br />
            <br />
            Immediately after the session I was very aware of my spinal column,
            I somehow felt energized and calm at the same time. For a time
            afterwards it seems like I noticed more of my the decisions I am
            making, I am a yoga teacher and I have a strong personal practice,
            so living slow and intentionaly is the norm, there was just a
            different quality to it. I am still on this journey and I am still
            understanding what has happened within me and it has been a couple
            of months already (at the time of writing this review).
            <br />
            <br />
            I highly recommend. You will definitely notice shifts one way or

            “I would like to start off by mentioning that I am someone who,
            generally speaking, does not truly believe anything that I
            can’t/haven’t verified using my own senses. This does not mean that
            I disregard any knowledge that I can’t prove, but rather, I view
            this knowledge as one of many possibilities. With this in mind, I
            will speak about my experiences before and after my life activation.
            <br />
            I did not actively seek out a life activation and I believe that I
            did not adequately prepare myself for it. I think the reason for
            this is that I, on some level, was sceptical of Jessica’s methods.
            This is due to the fact that Jessica works beyond my current
            understanding of the world and how it works. I have since come to
            the conclusion that it doesn’t matter whether or not I understand
            Jessica’s methods because the results speak for themselves. There
            have been a number of positive changes in my life, that occurred
            almost immediately after my life activation. Based on this evidence,
            the only logical inference is that these changes are a result of my
            life activation. One might wonder why I decided to take part in the
            life activation in the first place if I was somewhat sceptical of
            Jessica’s methods. This is because, based on my experiences and the
            time that I have spent with Jessica, I know that she is someone who
            is a force for good in this world and that she is here to make a
            difference. Jessica is one of the few people who I trust
            wholeheartedly and I know that everything that she does is done with
            wholesome intent, and her actions, whether directly or indirectly,
            make the world a better place. By virtue of my trust and belief in
            Jessica, I was left with no choice but to believe and trust in her
            methods.<br />
            As previously mentioned, there were a number of positive changes
            that occurred in my life after my life activation. The first and
            most apparent of these changes had to do with my academic career.
            Shortly after my life activation, I hit a “roadblock” with my
            studies. Usually, this would have sent me into a tailspin, as I
            would have been overcome with feelings of anxiety, frustration, and
            maybe even fear; however, this was not the case. Not only did I not
            experience any of these negative emotions, I actually had a feeling
            of calmness and acceptance when faced with my dilemma. I was able to
            calmly assess the situation I was in, and make changes to my life
            that allowed several new paths to open up to me. This change has not
            only provided me with the opportunity to advance my academic and
            professional career but it has also provided me with a path that I
            believe will allow me to reach my full potential in both a personal
            and spiritual capacity. <br />
            Another change that occurred after my life activation is my ability
            to let go of thoughts, feelings, behaviours, and beliefs that are
            counterproductive to me living a truly happy life. Even before my
            life activation, I knew that these things were harmful to me,
            however, for some reason, I was unable to let go of them. It was as
            if there was some unconscious mental block that prevented me from
            letting go, however, after my life activation, this mental block
            seems to have disappeared and now I have the ability to let go of
            things that are harmful and don’t serve me. It's not like I am now
            able to let go of everything all at once, but rather, it is a
            gradual process of assessment and elimination. I still have a lot of
            work to do with regards to this but I am grateful for what this
            ability has done for me thus far and I look forward to using this
            ability as I move forward in this new chapter of my life. <br />
            Lastly, what I deem as the most important change since my life
            activation, is the enhancement of my intuition. This has been a
            subtle change but I believe that it will become the most powerful
            guiding factor as I continue to progress through my life. As someone
            who has generally relied on logic and reasoning to navigate the
            world around them, I thought of intuition as some mythical fallacy
            and totally disregarded it. I believe that my intuition has always
            been there, however, I never followed it due to my own ignorance.
            Looking back, I do not view this ignorance as a good or bad thing
            but rather, a necessary step in order to get to where I am today. I
            now see that intuition is a means of directly perceiving reality and
            interacting with the world around me, without being hindered by
            logic and reasoning. Yes, the very foundation of my worldview
            actually serves as a hindrance to how I perceive the world around
            me. By relying on my intuition, it feels as if I am slowly escaping
            the trap that I have created within my mind. This does not mean that
            I have this whole intuition thing figured out or that I understand
            the processes behind it. If anything, it is quite the opposite.
            Metaphorically speaking, I am the frog in a well who knows nothing
            of the sea. However, thanks to Jessica, I now know that the “sea”
            exists and I look forward to gaining further insight into intuition
            and how it reveals itself. <br />
            All in all, I am extremely grateful that I had the opportunity to
            receive my life activation and I look forward to all the changes it
            will bring about in the future.”

            “My 2022 ended with strong mental shifts. Making me feel lost in
            what I needed to do. Having Jess as a friend, I decided to reach
            out.
            <br />
            I did a crystal healing and a life activation. It helped me to clear
            my head and to look deep within myself to bring the emotions to the
            surface and let them out. Just sitting and talking with Jess

            "I had an activation done by Jessica about 2 months ago and it was
            my first time being introduced to the experience. I had no
            expectations of what to expect and what it would entail and no
            expectations of where it would lead. It was a beautiful experience
            from the start and is continuing to be so even now. The contrast of
            gentle energy and powerful energy during the session was both
            profound and tangible. The result was immediate as I could feel that
            a gateway for healing had been opened. The path ahead is lighter
            than before. So much has changed for me. The life activation allowed
            me to be myself. It helped me shift the guilt and shame I held for
            many years. I have so much appreciation for her healing and so much
            gratitude for her love."

            "I decided to attend Life/ DNA Activation with dear Jess in time. My
            heart was craving changes, acceptance, and love.<br />
            Somewhere on the way after the session, I awake my understanding
            that I am enough, and that even is so heartbreaking, I have, and
            can, 'Let it go!'. <br />
            I reminded myself that belonging is lying in my heart all time long.
            During the session, I have a vision in my head, of releasing myself
            of chains and holders, taking dark cover off my back and stepping
            naked, free, in the future.
            <br />
            Fear of unknown change to hope and confidence, excitement, and
            strength.
            <br />
            I keep reminding myself every day since it is a journey. And I
            deserve and will not settle for nothing less than happiness. My
            fulfillment is awaiting for me in my future, dedication, and goals!
            I believe that universe, and my desire complied with my decision to
            meet Jessica and experience such vision! I believe that everything
            happens as it meant to be, and that was my moment of transition!
            Thank you, Jess, for being bless on my path."

            "I was very nervous and skeptical doing the life activation, hadn’t
            heard of or experienced this before.
            <br />
            Jess was an absolute Angel, guided me, reassured me, made sure I was
            totally informed throughout the process and was totally at peace
            with myself and the surroundings.
            <br />
            <br />
            She talked me gently through each step of the process and literally
            held my hand, killing all nervousness and any negativity or
            skepticism I might have had.
            <br />
            I have had some previous traumas and was going through quite a bad
            patch, and Jess kinda sensed that and made contact totally out of
            the blue, we’d known each other for some time and I had no idea she
            was practising these teachings.
            <br />
            Throughout the process I felt safe and at peace, felt the energy and
            peace, and it was really a journey visiting my past, closing those
            old wounds and negativity. I felt completely relaxed and would go so
            far as to say, cleansed.
            <br />
            Didn’t feel any changes immediately but the days after, I felt more
            energised, positivity flowed and the shift in energy was
            transforming, in the best possible way.
            <br />
            My self confidence increased ten fold, and I can’t even begin to
            describe the mental benefits to my health, sleep, diet and exercise.
            All these showed drastic changes and only for the better. I’ve cut
            off people that were toxic in my life, and refuse to accept anybody
            into my circle that brings any ounce of negativity or that does not
            add value or any harmony. My quality of life has experienced a
            drastic shift, moved to a new place, took that long overdue holiday,
            and noticed a tremendous shift in wealth. I’ve also begun giving
            back to those less fortunate around me and started uplifting those
            experiencing tough times all because I am now in a position to be
            able to do so. Jess, i can’t thank you enough, I am eternally
            grateful and so look forward to seeing you back in Cape Town so that
            i can maybe do this again or experience one of the other healing
            services you offer.
            <br />
            <br />
            Blessings, Peace and Abundance your way and may you continue to be a
            source of light."

            "I've been thinking a lot about the activation process you had in me
            and how some things have changed since then. I know for sure that
            the universe put you in my path at a time when I was already more
            energetically open to it and that everything happened at the right
            time. Looking back, it's like I was already in a process of change
            and the life activation energised and potentiated it to another
            level. At times, I feel as if my life is moving much faster, that
            feelings and experiences are more intense, that decisions are taken
            more quickly, that what needs to be said is communicated with more
            eloquence and accuracy, wills are more accepted and desires are
            fulfilled. It's as if things came to me with less effort and, in a
            way, as if I could believe more in an inner voice, which can be
            intuition, spirituality, guides. Anyway, be it what each person
            believes.
            <br />
            Every morning and evening, when I take my drops, it’s almost like
            I’m filling my body and spirit with a bit more of hope and strength
            to keep doing what I need to. On the other hand, as life goes, when
            something not that good happens and it’s s difficult to keep
            thinking positively, it’s like the activation of life also served to
            remind me of who I am and of all the good things I have and deserve.
            I feel like it's a mental and spiritual boost for me to follow my
            path. Again, I wanted to thank you for the afternoon we had during
            the activation and for suggesting this process to me. I will
            certainly not forget and I also know that much of what I am
            experiencing today is the outcome of this process that can be read
            in different ways but which, for me, is the result of my
            reconnection with myself, in mental, physical and spiritual aspects.
            <br />
            <br />
            Thank you so much and hope to see you soon!"

            "Today I had my first life activation with jess. I had no idea what
            to expect. Life has been very hard recently and I struggle with
            complex PTSD as an after effect. The experience was magical and
            beautiful. During the meditation something was present, actively
            opening me up and allowing for a light to shine in places it never
            has. A sense of understanding follows in the days after the session.
            - profound understanding. My life path actually felt like it's meant
            to go somewhere & isnt going to be cut short. It gave me the
            willingness and strength to keep going. I cannot say enough how
            powerful the experience has been during and after. I highly
            recommend a Life Activation with Jess. My body feels cleansed and
            detoxed from old energies that are no longer serving me. Thank you
            Jess."

            her gentle touch and powerful energy work, I felt a surge of
            vitality and purpose coursing through every cell of my being.
            Jessica's ability to tap into my innermost desires and help me align

            "Life activation with Jess was pure magic, in the moment but mostly
            the effects afterwards. When I first heard about it I wasn’t really
            sure what it meant. Jess explained it me thoroughly and
            energetically cleaned the room beforehand. I did the session mid May
            (it is now end of July), it was very powerful and a whirlwind of
            emotions came up but I felt safe and supported throughout. For me it
            set a chain of events in motion in the most positive way, and which
            I never really expected. I think it triggered a deeper understanding
            of where I was and where I want to be. I’ve come to the realisation
            that I was running away and numbing myself from certain aspects of
            life and never had the energy or understanding to do something about
            it. Since then, little by little I’ve been making smaller and bigger
            changes to my life. Paving the path to what I truly desire which is
            becoming clearer with each step I take. In my experience, life
            activation is a catalyst and just the beginning of becoming more
            clear and forming deeper and more meaningful connections with myself
            and my environment."
