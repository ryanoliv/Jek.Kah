          Experience the transformative power of Ensofic Ray Reiki, a healing
          modality that accelerates the healing process by aligning your body,
          soul, and spirit. This realignment brings your body back into balance,
          activating its innate ability to heal itself. <br />
          Reiki has the remarkable ability to flow to where it is most needed,
          creating a sense of balance, safety, and tranquility within you.
          Whether received in person or remotely, Ensofic Ray Reiki works as a
          cleansing ray of light, restoring your cells to their original state.
          It targets the physical body, the aura, emotions, and the energetic
          field, offering holistic healing on multiple levels.
          <br />
          <br />
          While Ensofic Reiki is particularly beneficial for physical body
          healing, it also extends its healing effects to the mental, spiritual,
          and emotional realms. A single session can be powerful and beneficial,
          but to achieve optimal results, I recommend a package of three
          sessions.
          <br />
          <br />
          For a comprehensive healing experience, a Reiki session can be
          combined with crystal, chakra, and aura healings, enhancing the
          energetic and transformative effects.

        <!-- <p>
          The human body has an innate ability to heal itself in a proper
          supportive environment. Unfortunately, the body's many imbalances from
          stress, anger, anxiety, and worry prohibit this natural healing
          process. The Ensofic Ray/Reiki protocol accelerates healing by
          aligning your body, soul, and spirit. This brings your body back into
          balance to start to heal itself. Reiki has the ability to go to where
          you need it most, creating a sense of balance, safety, and
          tranquillity. Reiki is a powerful and effective healing energy.
          Ensofic Reiki works as a ray of cleansing light that flows through the
          body and returns cells to their original state. Reiki targets the
          physical body, the aura, emotions, and the energetic field. Many
          clients who have received reiki healings reported decreased anxiety,
          increased vitality, healed digestive issues, reduced stress,
          depression, and inflammation.
          <br />
          <br />
          A reiki session can also be combined with essential oils, crystals,
          and aura healing.

          This healing is available as a single session, but it is recommended
          to receive a series of three sessions spaced a week to ten days apart
          for the best results. Each session acts as a series for the best
          results.

        <h2>What Is Reiki?</h2>
        <p>
          Reiki is a gentle but powerful Japanese energy healing modality dating
          back nearly 100 years. The Ensofic Ray Healing Modality (Reiki) is the
          secret method of finding pure joy in life. Reiki is a part of the
          Ensofic Ray Healing Modality; it is not hands-on healing to alleviate
          physical conditions. The Ensofic Ray Healing Modality is the complete
          system of reiki brought to us by Dr. Usui and Sanat Kumara.
          <br />
          <br />
          The modality is designed to lead humanity to its next level of
          evolution - ANJIN RYUMEI - which means “living life alive”. Ensofic
          Ray comes from the ray of Ensof - which is the ultimate source. As we
          do the training, the attunements of the Ensof Reiki open us up to flow
          this ray through our body and then to someone else. We receive such
          deep healing when we do healings on others because the ray flows right
          through us.

            "I am beyond grateful that Jess has introduced reiki into my life. I
            was initially a little sceptical and not 100% convinced of the
            benefits or how much of an impact a few reiki sessions could have on
            me but I decided to give it a chance last year March as I was
            curious, and I’m so glad I did! After just the first session I felt
            calmer and more level-headed. Every session after that built on that
            initial experience and got better and better. I felt more focused,
            less anxious, and more productive in my day to day. It felt like a
            weight had been lifted off my shoulders and I was free to carry out
            my daily responsibilities without anything holding me back. I also
            felt I could connect with others easier as I felt more present and
            less in my head and anxious. Jess is extremely professional and
            knows how to create a safe space for her clients so that they feel
            they can just be themselves and relax. She is warm and empathetic,
            and lovingly welcomes you into her peaceful and ambient space which
            immediately evokes a sense of calm, and through a brief discussion
            helps you to hone in on a specific intention to focus on throughout
            the session. I highly recommend not only reiki, but also Jess in
            particular, to anyone considering embarking on this journey!
            Absolutely everyone can benefit enormously from a regular reiki
            practice."

            "I went to Jess for three incredibly transformative reiki sessions.
            Jess held space so beautifully and resorted my energy from a place
            of depletion to a place of hope and growth. Her gentle yet firm
            presence made me feel vulnerable enough to open up and let go,
            whilst still focusing on my own innate power to heal and grow. She
            planted seeds of expansion where I felt so stuck. She made me
            believe in myself, in the power of subtle energy, and in the power
            to change and grow. I feel that Jess is an extremely special soul
            who came to Earth with a purpose- to invite others to heal
            themselves and she is practicing this through her beautiful reiki
            sessions. Jess, I can't thank you enough for the love and healing
            that you poured into my body and mind. It was felt and treasured and
            carried me when I needed it most. Thank you. ♥️🙏"

            "I was very fortunate enough to catch Jess when she was visiting
            Cape Town for a few months and decided to open up a Reiki studio and
            offer Reiki sessions part time for a few months during her stay. I
            was going through one of the hardest changes in my life and really
            struggling to adapt and move forward with things.. Jess reached out
            and introduced me to reiki. I experienced two reiki healing sessions
            with her and found them very powerful and emotional. After each
            session I felt a deep sense of relaxation and calmness due to her
            beautiful energy and reiki magic as well as more ‘light’ in my head
            and emotions. After the first session the following day I was very
            emotionally and cried quite a lot which helped with releasing and
            letting go of what I was struggling to come to terms with. I
            definitely think if Jessica had stayed in Cape Town I would have
            loved to have carried on with reiki with her as I think it really
            would have helped my emotional state and help delve in and release
            past traumas, including childhood ones that we only identify later
            on in life… Jessica is also amazing to chat to and so wise. She’s
            got kind and gentle energy and I think she makes the most wonderful
            reiki healer. I highly recommend booking a session with her and
            giving reiki a try! "

            "I have had the honor to experience many different healing
            modalities throughout my life, however I had never experienced Reiki
            until I found Jess. It is hard for me to completely open up to
            healers, yet I felt very comfortable under Jess's hands. I went for
            a weekly session, over a month, and It was an hour every week that I
            was able to release, let go and give myself a moment of self love.
            In today's stressful world, it's hard to have a complete break from
            the chaos and so, just that one hour with Jess was enough time to
            reboot, and re-energize. I was able to shift stagnant energy and
            relieve emotional stress that had built up and was stored in my
            body. I couldn't recommend Reiki more, to anyone who is in need of a
            moment of self, a moment of breath and a moment of connection, to
            your spiritial being."

            it was the first time I was truly aware of my energy before and
            after a session. Having not done many reiki session in my lifetime I
            was sure to set a specific intention which was set to help me relive
            myself of a creative block I’d been struggling with. Her work
            allowed myself and my space to be free of my block. It is a pretty
            indescribable feeling, especially when your personal knowledge is
            not in depth on the healing process. It also relived some pain
            caused by an autoimmune which was an added bonus and something I may
            not have been aware was connected to my block if I had not been open
            to the session. I recommend anyone to open yourself up to Jess and

            "Floating out of my first session with Jess changed my reality about
            the Reiki practice. Jeh.Kah. I didn’t believe someone could guide
            the flow of energy, but I certainly felt it when I was in this
            nurturing space – in Jess’s presence: Jessica exudes love and is
            wise beyond her years. An old soul who intuitively knows what your
            body needs to reduce stress and promote healing. Not only does Jess
            balance your chakras, but she calms your nervous system and connects
            your body with its spiritual energy. I felt connected to Spirit.
            “The greatest good you can do for another is not just share your
            riches, but to reveal to him his own.” ― Benjamin Disraeli. I have
            been to sessions with Jess that felt like 3 minutes although an
            actual hour had elapsed. Jess ‘holds’ you in a safe space. She
            senses your energy with the lightest touch. Tingling. Travelling.
            Teleporting. Surreal sensations for sure. Connect with Jeh.Kah.
            Connect with your highest self."
