          <h2>About Jessica</h2>
          <p class="justified">
            Jessica Rea is a Life Activation Practitioner, Meditation Teacher,
            Ensofic Reiki & SG Crystal Healer, certified through the Modern
            Mystery School. She’s an intuitive Healer and coach by nature who
            teaches mindfulness & meditation. Jessica embodies the belief that
            you can access infinite power through alternative and natural
            methods. As a Healer, she focuses on energetic & spiritual healing
            as well as life empowerment. Her innate passion is to assist
            individuals in finding their unique path toward self-discovery.
            Jessica helps people from all walks of life break through their
            barriers, blocks, and traumas. With many practices focusing on the
            integration of our masculine and feminine energy in order to love,
            heal and accept oneself.
            <br />
            <br />
            Being a highly sensitive empath at such a young age proved to be
            difficult, yet over the years, her sensitivity turned into her
            strength. As she grew and understood herself better, she realised
            she held an innate gift for healing. Today, she has learned to
            harness these skills into tools to craft self-love and the ability
            to hold space for others on their journey. Jessica has healed &
            grown through many challenges and traumas such as eating disorders,
            body dysmorphia, substance abuse, addictive behaviours, codependency
            and bullying in her younger years. She believes by growing through
            these she has learnt important tools along with her studied skills
            to guide you through too. She found help in recovery and, in 2015,
            started her healing journey with both inpatient and outpatient
            recovery assistance. While in recovery, she found her strength in
            healing, public speaking, and leadership. Jessica became chairwoman
            and speaker for large groups of people on sensitive, empowering and
            traumatic topics; helping others from every walk of life to find
            light in their own journey. Her experiences in life have given her a
            voice in which she chooses to use to speak to the public about
            topics that are deep & real with compassion.
            <br />
            <br />
            Jessica enhances her guidance with her
            <a class="link darker" href="/cuisine.html">culinary</a> knowledge &
            experience. Through her journey she has realised how hugely we are
            impacted by not only what we feed our mind but also what we feed our
            body. She weaves her passion for body nourishment into her
            teachings, coaching, and healing. Helping one cultivate a healing
            relationship with food & their body.
            <br />
            <br />
            Healing has completely changed her life. Now, she wishes to help you
            transform yours. With meditation, habit building & energy work being
            the core of her healings & guidance.
